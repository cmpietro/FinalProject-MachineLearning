,,,,,,,,,,Caveats:,1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,1. 'Suppressed' appears when the data do not meet the criteria for confidentiality constraints. More information:,1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/help/Natality-expanded.html#Assurance of Confidentiality.,1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,"2. 'Not Applicable' appears when an average value can not be calculated for the categories ""Not Stated"" or ""Unknown"".",1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,3. Each birth record represents one living baby.,1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,4. Caution should be used when interpreting the Average Age of Mother measure. All ages 12 years and less are coded to 12 years.,1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,All ages 50 years and over are coded to 50 years. The number of counts in those two age goups are small and should not have a,1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,great effect on the average age. Consider doing queries with and without these two age groups and compare the effect on Average,1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,Age of Mother measure.,1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,"5. Records where the ""Birth Weight"" is ""Unknown or Not Stated"" are not included in the calculation of the ""Average Birth",1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,"Weight"" measure.",1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,"6. Records where the gestation age is ""Unknown or Not Stated"" are not included in the calculation of the ""Average Gestational",1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,"Age"" measure.",1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,"7. Records where the ""BMI"" is ""Unknown or Not Stated"" are not included in the calculation of the ""Average Pre-pregnancy",1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,"BMI"" measure.",1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,"8. Records where the ""Number of Prenatal Visits"" is ""Unknown or Not Stated"" are not included in the calculation of the",1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,"""Average Number of Prenatal Visits"" measure.",1,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,,"9. Records where the ""Interval Since Last Live Birth"" is ""Unknown or Not Stated"" or ""Zero to 3 months"" are not included in",1,,,,,,,,,
