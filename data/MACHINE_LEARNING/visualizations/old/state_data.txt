Caveats:
"1. Each birth record represents one living baby."
"2. Birth rates are calculated as the number of births divided by total population in the given year(s). When the numerator is"
"sub-set by mother's race, mother's hispanicity, location, or year of birth, then the same sub-set for age, race, hispanicity,"
"location and year applies to the denominator population."
"3. Fertility rates are calculated as the number of births divided by the number of females age 15 - 44 years old in the given"
"year(s). When the numerator is sub-set by mother's age, mother's race, mother's hispanicity, location, or year of birth, then"
"the same sub-set for age, race, hispanicity, location and year applies to the denominator population. However, if you sub-set"
"mother's age selecting some years not in the 15 - 44 range, those years of mother's age ouside this range will not be included"
"in the denominator population. If you sub-set mother's age selecting only years outside the 15 - 44 range, the denominator"
"population returned will be zero and flagged ""Not Available""."
"4. Caution should be used when interpreting the Average Age of Mother measure. All ages 12 years and less are coded to 12 years."
"All ages 50 years and over are coded to 50 years. The number of counts in those two age goups are small and should not have a"
"great effect on the average age. Consider doing queries with and without these two age groups and compare the effect on Average"
"Age of Mother measure."
"5. Please note that the Percent of Total presented here may not be consistent with percentages published by NCHS. NCHS excludes"
"births categorized as ""Unknown"", ""Not Stated"", and ""Not on Certificate"" from the denominator when calculating percentages."
"6. Records where the ""Birth Weight"" is ""Unknown or Not Stated"" are not included in the calculation of the ""Average Birth"
"Weight"" measure."
"7. Records where the gestation age is ""Unknown or Not Stated"" are not included in the calculation of the ""Average Gestational"
"Age"" measure."
"8. Records where the ""Number of Prenatal Visits"" is ""Unknown or Not Stated"" are not included in the calculation of the"
"""Average Number of Prenatal Visits"" measure."
"9. Birth rates and fertility rates are calculated using the following populations: The populations for year 2018 are from the"
"postcensal single-race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by Census Bureau on June 21, 2018; and"
"the postcensal bridged-race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released by NCHS on June 27, 2018. The"
"populations for year 2016 are from the postcensal single-race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population, released"
"by Census Bureau on June 22, 2017; and the postcensal bridged-race series of July 1st estimates of the resident population,"
