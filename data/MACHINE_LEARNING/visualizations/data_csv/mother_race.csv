,,,,,,,,,1. Rows with zero Births are hidden. Use Quick Options above to show zero rows.,1,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,---,1,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,Caveats:,1,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,1. Each birth record represents one living baby.,1,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,2. Caution should be used when interpreting the Average Age of Mother measure. All ages 12 years and less are coded to 12 years.,1,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,All ages 50 years and over are coded to 50 years. The number of counts in those two age goups are small and should not have a,1,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,great effect on the average age. Consider doing queries with and without these two age groups and compare the effect on Average,1,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,Age of Mother measure.,1,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,3. Please note that the Percent of Total presented here may not be consistent with percentages published by NCHS. NCHS excludes,1,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,"births categorized as ""Unknown"", ""Not Stated"", and ""Not on Certificate"" from the denominator when calculating percentages.",1,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,"4. Records where the ""Birth Weight"" is ""Unknown or Not Stated"" are not included in the calculation of the ""Average Birth",1,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,"Weight"" measure.",1,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,"5. Records where the gestation age is ""Unknown or Not Stated"" are not included in the calculation of the ""Average Gestational",1,,,,,
